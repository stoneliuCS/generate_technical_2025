# Generate Software Engineer Technical Challenge
You are tasked with completing one technical deliverable for your Generate Software Engineer interview. The deliverable consists of completing one technical challenge prior to your interview, and then conducting a walkthrough of your solution during your interview. Your walkthrough must include screensharing of your code, you may be asked to submit your solution, and you are not expected to prepare additional visuals or writings.

# Technical Challenges
# Backend
The backend track has two options, one of which focuses on algorithm implementation and the other focuses on server-side development. If you choose the backend track, **you are not expected to complete both options.**

The algorithmic challenge is considerably more difficult, and if you choose to complete it, we will factor in the difficulty during your interview. That being said, the server-side challenge is non-trivial, and may be more accessible for less-experienced engineers.
### Backend (Algorithmic)
### Backend (Server)
## Frontend
The frontend track tests your ability to match a Figma specification, manage state, fetch data, and and structure your frontend code with reusable components, reasonable file structure, and documentation.
